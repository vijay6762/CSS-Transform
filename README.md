# CSS-Transform
This time, I have created a transformation on a block. Hover on that block to see the output and move the cursor for reversing the transformation.

The CSS transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, and skew elements.

With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation functions:

- translate()
- rotate()
- scaleX()
- scaleY()
- scale()
- skewX()
- skewY()
- skew()
- matrix()
